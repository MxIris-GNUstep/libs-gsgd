gsgd was written by Manuel Guesdon <mguesdon@orange-concept.com>.

gsgd is an Objc interface to libgd library. libgd is a library to create 
PNG and Jpeg images.

You need libgd, available at http://www.boutell.com/gd

gsgd has been tested with libgd 1.8.1 (PNG/Jpeg version).

GDGIFPlot is not finished so I've commented it.
